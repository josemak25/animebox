## üìù Contribution Guidelines

- **Base branch:** Always branch from and target `develop` for new features and fixes.
- **Code style:** Follow the existing TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier rules. Run `yarn lint` and `yarn format` before committing.
- **Testing:** All new features and bug fixes must include tests. Use Jest and follow examples in `helpers/__tests__/`.
