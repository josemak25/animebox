# AnimeBOX

AnimeBOX is a modern React Native application built with Expo, TypeScript, and
Drizzle ORM, designed for anime collection management and seamless mobile
consumption of anime content. The project focuses on building an advanced HTML
data parser that takes PHP-based web responses from animepahe.ru and converts
them into a clean JSON format, making the data easier to consume within a mobile
app.

## 🚀 Project Goal

AnimeBOX aims to reverse engineer the data flow of
[animepahe.ru](https://animepahe.ru), a web-only anime streaming site with
secure video streaming and no open API. The core objective is to:

- Parse and extract anime data from PHP-based HTML responses
- Convert extracted data into structured, consumable JSON
- Enable mobile-friendly access to anime content and metadata
- Maintain secure, reliable, and efficient data handling

## 🌍 Why This Approach?

Animepahe.ru does not provide a public API, making it inaccessible for mobile
apps by default. By reverse engineering the site's data flow and parsing its
HTML responses, AnimeBOX bridges this gap, allowing users to:

- Browse, search, and bookmark anime titles
- Access episode lists, streaming links, and metadata
- Enjoy a native mobile experience with offline and responsive features

## 🗂️ Project Structure

The project follows a modular, scalable architecture. For detailed structure,

- **Drizzle ORM** (SQLite)
- **Expo Router** (file-based navigation)
- **react-native-size-matters** (responsive design)
- **Jest** (testing)

## 📦 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   # Clone the AnimeBOX repository from GitHub
   git clone https://github.com/josemak25/animebox.git
   # Navigate to the project directory
   cd animebox
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
   # Install all required packages and dependencies
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Run the app:**

   ```sh
   # Start the Expo development server
   yarn start
   ```

## 🧩 HTML Data Parsing Approach

- Uses custom helpers to fetch and parse HTML from animepahe.ru
- Extracts relevant data (titles, episodes, streams) from PHP-based responses
- Converts to JSON for use in the app's state and UI
- Handles anti-bot and security measures where possible
