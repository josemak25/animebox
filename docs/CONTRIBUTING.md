# Contributing to AnimeBOX

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AnimeBOX! Your help is essential
for building a robust, high-quality anime data parser and mobile app. This guide
will help you get started and ensure a smooth contribution process.

## üö¶ Quick Start

1. **Fork the repository** and clone your fork:

   ```sh
   # Clone your fork of the AnimeBOX repository
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/animebox.git
   # Navigate to the project directory
   cd animebox
   ```

2. **Create a new branch** for your feature or fix:

   ```sh
   # Create and checkout a new feature branch
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   # Alternative: Create a bugfix branch
   # git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
   # Install all project dependencies using Yarn
   yarn install
   # Verify installation completed successfully
   yarn --version
   ```

4. **Make your changes** and commit with a descriptive message:

   ```sh
   # Stage all changes for commit
   git add .
   # Commit with conventional commit message
   git commit -m "feat: add new parser for episode list"
   # Alternative examples:
   # git commit -m "fix: resolve parsing error in episode data"
   # git commit -m "docs: update API documentation"
   ```

5. **Push your branch** and open a pull request (PR) against `develop`:

   ```sh
   # Push your feature branch to your fork
   git push origin feat/your-feature-name
   # If this is the first push, set upstream tracking
   # git push -u origin feat/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Fill out the PR template** and ensure all checks pass.

## üìù Contribution Guidelines

- **Base branch:** Always branch from and target `develop` for new features and
  fixes.
- **Code style:** Follow the existing TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier rules.
  Run `yarn lint` and `yarn format` before committing.
- **Testing:** All new features and bug fixes must include tests. Use Jest and
  follow examples in `helpers/__tests__/`.
- **Documentation:** Update or add documentation as needed (see
  `docs/STRUCTURE.md`).
- **Commits:** Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
  for commit messages (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`).
- **PR template:** Complete all sections of the pull request template for
  clarity and review efficiency.
- **No debug output:** Use proper error handling and logging patterns (see
  `.github/copilot-instructions.md`).

## üß™ Running Tests

- Run all tests:

  ```sh
  # Execute the complete test suite
  yarn test
  # Run tests with detailed coverage report
  yarn test --coverage
  # Run tests in watch mode for active development
  yarn test --watch
  # Run specific test file
  # yarn test helpers/__tests__/parser.test.ts
  ```

- Check test coverage:

  # Generate and display coverage report
  yarn test --coverage
  # Open coverage report in browser (if available)
  # open coverage/lcov-report/index.html
  ```
